# Link-Validator
A simple web app to list links from a URL. In order to run this app simply clone the repo and from the main directory:
```
cd lib
npm install && bower install
```
This will allow you to run the program with the dependencies I have installed. I am serving files using http-server. If you have it, run `http-server` from the main directory.
